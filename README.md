# Description
A web app to fetch and display real-time weather data for any location.

## How to Run
- **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/PeterBredell/WeatherWebsite`
- **Open locally**: Drag `index.html` into a browser or use a local server (e.g., `live-server` in VS Code).
- **API Key**: Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), get a free API key, and add it to `script.js` (e.g., `const key = "your-key-here";`).

## Demo
Enter a city name, hit search, and see the latest weather—temp!

## What I Learned and practiced
While building this Weather Web App, I leveled up my skills in web development and APIs. Here’s what I picked up:

- **HTML/CSS**: Structured and styled a clean, responsive interface for weather info.
- **JavaScript**: Wrote dynamic code to fetch and display data from a weather API.
- **API Integration**: Connected to a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to pull real-time weather data.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Used `fetch()` and promises/async-await to handle API requests smoothly.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Updated the webpage live with weather details like temp and conditions.
- **Web Development Workflow**: Managed files, tested locally, and deployed to GitHub.
- **Portfolio Mindset**: Built a practical app that shows off my coding chops and problem-solving.

This project blended front-end skills with real-world data—perfect prep for bigger web challenges!
